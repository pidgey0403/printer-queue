# printer-simulator
Synposis: Using a linked list, simulate how a printer functions by inserting newly generated documents into the printer queue, while printing out the highest priority print job, over a set number of cycles.

Another student project, this time with the goals of: exploring the creation and use of structures, passing and using pointers to functions, allocating dynamic memory for pointers and arrays, using preprocessor commands for debugging purposes, and employing header files to implement functions.
