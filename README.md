# printer-simulator
Using a linked list, simulate how a printer functions by inserting newly generated documents into the printer queue, while printing out the highest priority print job, over a set number of cycles.

Another student project for my Intro to C and Unix class, this time with the goals of exploring the creation and use of structures, passing pointers to functions, more complex pointer manipulation,  allocating dynamic memory for pointers and arrays, using preprocessor commands for debugging purposes, and employing header files to implement functions.

All files authored by me.
